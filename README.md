## Abstract
Airbnb listings provide new and unique ways to explore a city. The site, which allows homeowners in the city to open up and share their space with visitors, shares listing information such as the listing’s location, price per night, and house rules. Using listing location and house rules, our team conducted a regional analysis of Los Angeles by comparing the average “strictness” level of regions in the city based on data from its Airbnb listings. We created two new variables, region and strictness, to conduct this analysis. We found that listings in West Los Angeles are stricter, on average, than listings in East Los Angeles. We also found No Smoking and No Partying to be the most common house rules in the city.
